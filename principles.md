The term “open data” refers to publicly available data structured in such a way that enables the data to be fully discoverable and usable by end users.  In general, open data will be consistent with the following principles:

## Public 
"Open data" adopts a presumption in favor of openness to the extent permitted by law and subject to privacy, confidentiality, security or other valid restrictions. 

## Accessible 
Open data are made available in convenient and modifiable open formats that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications.  Formats should be machine-readable (i.e., data are reasonably structured to allow automated processing).  Open data structures do not discriminate against any person or group of persons and should be made available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes, often by providing the data in multiple formats for consumption.  Open data should be made available in an open standard that has a publicly available specification that places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use.

## Described 
Open data are fully described so that consumers of the data have sufficient information to understand its strengths, weaknesses, analytical limitations, security requirements, as well as how to process it.  This involves the use of robust, granular metadata (i.e., fields or elements that describe data), thorough documentation of data elements, data dictionaries, and, if applicable, a user’s guide that describes the purpose of the collection, the population of interest, the characteristics of the sample (if applicable), and the method of data collection. 

## Reusable 
Open data are made available under an open license that allows for modification and derivative work with, at most, a requirement to include attribution of the open data source in the distribution of any such derivative work.

## Complete 
Open data are published in primary forms as collected at the source, with the finest possible level of granularity that is practicable and permitted by law and other requirements, not in aggregate or modified forms.  Derived or aggregate open data may also be published but must reference the primary data.

## Timely 
Open data are made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data. Frequency of release should account for key audiences and downstream needs.

## Managed Post-Release
A contact person must be designated to assist people trying to use the open data and to respond to complaints about adherence to these open data requirements.







In order for data to be open, it must adhere to the following principles:

## Public Data Must Be Public

Public data must be publicly accessible with no barriers to access. Fundamentally this means public data is publically discoverable, machine readable, and instantly accessible from any device. Public data are data that are not subject to valid privacy, security or privilege limitations, as governed by other statutes.

## Data Must Be Complete

All public data are made available. Data are electronically stored information or recordings, including but not limited to tables, charts, geospatial data, content, documents, databases, transcripts, and audio/visual recordings. 

## Data Must Be Described

All data must be appropriately described. Primary Data are published as collected at the source, with the finest possible level of granularity, not in aggregate or modified forms. Derived or aggregate data used for secondary purposed by non-collecting agency, must source the primary data.

## Data Must Be Timely

Data are made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data.

## Data Must Be Machine Processable

Data are reasonably structured to allow automated processing of it.

## Data Must Be Accessible 

Data are available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes, often in multiple formats for consumption, and must not discriminate against any person or group of persons. The work must be available in a convenient and modifiable open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications. 

## Absence of Technological Restriction

The work must be provided in such a form that there are no technological obstacles to the performance of the above activities. This can be achieved by the provision of the work in an open  standard, i.e. one whose specification is publicly and freely available and which places no restrictions monetary or otherwise upon its use.

## Data Must Be Reusable

Data are available in non-proprietary formats over which no entity has exclusive control and data are reusable under open licenses and must allow for modifications and derivative works and must allow them to be distributed under the terms of the original work. 

## Compliance must be reviewabl

A contact person must be designated to respond to people trying to use the data. A contact person must be designated to respond to complaints about violations of the principles. An administrative or judicial court must have the jurisdiction to review whether the agency has applied these principles appropriately.
