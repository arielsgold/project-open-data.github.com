In order for data to be open, it must adhere to the following principles:

## Public Data Must Be Public

Public data must be publicly accessible with no barriers to access. Fundamentally this means public data is machine readable, publically discoverable, and instantly accessible from any device. Public data are data that are not subject to valid privacy, security or privilege limitations, as governed by other statutes.

## Data Must Be Complete

All public data are made available. Data are electronically stored information or recordings, including but not limited to tables, charts, geospatial data, content, documents, databases, transcripts, and audio/visual recordings. 

## Data Must Be Described

All data must be appropriately described. Primary Data are published as collected at the source, with the finest possible level of granularity, not in aggregate or modified forms. Derived or aggregate data used for secondary purposed by non-collecting agency, must source the primary data.

## Data Must Be Timely

Data are made available as quickly as necessary to preserve the value of the data.

## Data Must Be Machine Processable

Data are reasonably structured to allow automated processing of it.

## Data Must Be Accessible 

Data are available to the widest range of users for the widest range of purposes, often in multiple formats for consumption, and must not discriminate against any person or group of persons. The work must be available in a convenient and modifiable open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications. 

## Absence of Technological Restriction

The work must be provided in such a form that there are no technological obstacles to the performance of the above activities. This can be achieved by the provision of the work in an open  standard, i.e. one whose specification is publicly and freely available and which places no restrictions monetary or otherwise upon its use.

## Data Must Be Reusable

Data are available in non-proprietary formats over which no entity has exclusive control and data are reusable under open licenses and must allow for modifications and derivative works and must allow them to be distributed under the terms of the original work. 

## Compliance must be reviewabl

A contact person must be designated to respond to people trying to use the data. A contact person must be designated to respond to complaints about violations of the principles. An administrative or judicial court must have the jurisdiction to review whether the agency has applied these principles appropriately.
